<!-- ### GENERAL ### -->

<h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>
KitServer 5.2 is an add-on program for Pro Evolution Soccer 5, Winning Eleven 9, and
Winning Eleven 9 Liveware Evolution. It is a loader and manager for various modules.
KitServer Module 5.2.3 provides the alternative way of managing players and goalkeeper kits
outside of the game's AFS file: you organize the PNG or BMP kit images into an external
database, which is basically a collection of folders and files that follows few simple rules.
You are not restricted to just 1st and 2nd kit for each team - you can have as many as you like.
The BallServer Module 5.2.3 does similar things to KitServer, it offers the
possibility of chosing a ball from the external database. Of course it is possible to store
more than the eight standard balls. Another extension is the FaceServer Module 5.2.3. As the name
says, it allows to use more faces and hair from an external database without overwriting existing
ones. With StadiumServer 5.2.3, you can choose additional stadiums from your GDB. Furthermore the
LOD Mixer Module 5.2.3 enables more detailed graphics and controlling of match aspects in Leagues
and Cups. <i>Bootserver was backported from Kitserver 6, and currently works only with WE9LE.</i>
</p>

<h3>1.2 Installation</h3>

<p>
As usual: copy the entire kitserver folder into your game folder, so
that the directory structure looks like this:
</p>

<img src="install.jpg" />

<p>
Go to kitserver folder and run setup.exe. The "PES5.exe" in the
drop-down list should be pre-selected, so just press "Install" button.
The kitserver should show a message box saying that the installation
was successful. (If you get an error message, make sure that you
not currently running the game, and that the PES5.exe file is not 
marked as read-only)
</p>

<p>
For information how to disable/re-enable individual modules, see <a href="#advconfig"> "Advanced
Configuration"</a> at the bottom of the manual.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Removal</h3>

<p>
Go to kitserver folder and run setup.exe. The "PES5.exe" in the
drop-down list should be pre-selected. (Select it, if not so). Press "Remove" button.
The kitserver should show a message box saying that the uninstallation
was successful. You can now delete the whole kitserver folder, if you
want. (Or you can leave it there - it won't do any harm, and you'll be able to quickly
re-enable kitserver later, if you run setup again and press "Install" button.)
</p>



<!-- ### KITSERVER ### -->

<h2 id="kitserver">KitServer Module 5.2.3 (kserv.dll)</h2>

<h3>2.1 Quick summary of the features</h3>
<p>
<li><b>2.5D kits display on "Strip Selection" screen</b><br />
(2.5D meaning that these are mini-kits in two dimensions, but built from
actual kit textures used in the game.)</li>
<li><b>Extra kits for players and goalkeepers</b><br />
Now you can have more than just 1st and 2nd kit, but also 3rd,4th,etc. 
You can also mix the parts of all kits.</li>
<li><b>New database structure</b><br />
"KDB" has been renamed to "GDB" (Graphics DataBase), as it contains more than just
kits, but also balls and faces (and eventually more graphics later). The internal
structure is also completely new. Old structure wasn't well suited for extra kits,
but this new one is really flexible. Once you get used to it, you'll notice it's
easier to navigate than the Kitserver 5.0 KDB.</li>
<li><b>HighDefinition Pro Evolution Soccer (HDPES) support</b><br />
This is the latest change in Kitserver 5.2.1. Parts of the internal logic were
changed so that you can use bigger textures now. Also there is no more need of
shared palettes as 24 and 32 bit images are possible now, offering more than 16.7 million
colors! Still you can keep your existing GDB, 256 color images will be converted internally
and will work for mixing as well, even with kits of other sizes and color depths.</li>
</p>


<h3>2.2 GDB organization</h3>
<p>
So we start with the GDB, as the most dramatic change of way kitserver works (compared to 
version 5.0). The GDB contains a folder named <b>uni</b>, which is responsible for storing
the team kits (uniforms). The single most important file inside <b>uni</b> is called <b>map.txt</b>.
This file tells kitserver where to find the kits for particular team. As you know, each team
has a unique id - a integer number from 0 to 201, i think (+ some extra all-star teams). So
for every team in the GDB, you must specify in the map.txt, where the kits are for this team.
Here is an example:

<pre>
# This config maps team number into folder name
# Format: &lt;team-num&gt;,"&lt;folder name&gt;"
# Example: 21,"Russia"

8,"National\France"
9,"National\Germany"
65,"EPL\Aston_Villa"
75,"EPL\Man Utd"
77,"EPL\Newcastle"
80,"EPL\Tottenham"
170,"La Liga\Real Madrid"
</pre>
</p>

<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Double quotes are required - just so that there is no ambiguity about 
folder name. For IDs for all the teams - see <a href="uni.txt">uni.txt</a> file</div>

<p>
Please note that the sample GDB (provided with kitserver) is just one possible way of organizing the teams and 
folders. It uses "EPL" folder to group all english teams, "National" - to group all national
teams, and so for. You may find that you just prefer a flat list of folders - without these
extra groups. In that case, just modify the <b>map.txt</b> file accordingly, and create
the structure of folders that you prefer. That's the main advantage of having map.txt - the
flexibility of kit organization.
</p>

<p>
You can see from map.txt above that in order to find a kit for team #8, the kitserver needs to go to the 
folder <b>GDB\uni\National\France</b>. This folder will contain all of the kits that are
available to team #8. Inside it, you must create an individual folder for each kit. Like this:

<img src="france.jpg"/>

For players, 1st kit must have a folder name <b>pa</b>, 2nd - <b>pb</b>. Extra kits can have 
any folder names that start with letter "p". I found it useful to prefix all extra kits with 
<b>px-</b>. For example, <b>px-blue</b>. For the goalkeepers, 1st kit must be in the folder
<b>ga</b>, 2nd - in the <b>gb</b>. Extra kits can have any folder names that start with letter "g".
</p>

<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Folder name acts as a kind of ID for kitserver, which puts the 
additional restriction on all those folder names: they cannot contain spaces, and preferably
they should be relatively short, and in English,French or other language withing Latin1 
(iso8859-1) character set. Typically, if you want to make sure kitserver can properly
find/read the folder, just use latin characters, digits, underscore, and the dash (minus sign).
</div>

<p>
Now let's move on inside one of the kit folders. Take <b>pa</b>, for example.

<img src="pa.jpg" />

This is how you folder will look, if you have a so-called "all-in-one" kit, meaning that 
it's not split into separate parts: shirt, shorts, and socks. Kitserver can successfully
work with split kits and all-in-one kits, as it would automatically split the all-in-one
kit at runtime if you are mixing parts. 
</p>

<div class="note">In order for runtime split to work, make sure you don't delete the
folder called <b>masks</b>. It should be inside <b>uni</b>. Kitserver uses the mask
images to do the automatic split of all-in-one kits.</div>

<p>
Generally there is no problem using all-in-one kits. Anyway you may want to use split kits
when you don't have all the parts or want to add a single part and not a whole kit because
you already have that shirt and you don't want it to appear twice in Strip Selection. For example,
see Newcastle's <b>px-away2</b> folder: it doesn't have the <b>all.png</b>, but instead contains
<b>shorts.png</b> and <b>socks.png</b>. Notice that there is no <b>shirt.png</b> in there, which
is totally fine: the kitserver will just use the shorts and socks, and take a shirt from a different
folder.
</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</br>
Having the <b>all.png</b> is equivalent to having these three: <b>shirt.png</b>, <b>shorts.png</b>, and
<b>socks.png</b>. (Generally, you shouldn't have all four of them, or all.png and say shirt.png - 
this will quickly become confusing.)
</p>

<div class="note">Images can be either PNG or BMP format. So the filename must have 
either ".png" or ".bmp" extensions. It's ok to mix formats for given kit: you can have
<b>shirt.bmp</b>, <b>shorts.png</b>, <b>socks.bmp</b></div>

<p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Reserved PNG file name</th><th>Reserved BMP file name</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
    <tr><td>all.png</td><td>all.bmp</td><td>all-in-one kit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>shirt.png</td><td>shirt.bmp</td><td>shirt</td></tr>
    <tr><td>shorts.png</td><td>shorts.bmp</td><td>shorts</td></tr>
    <tr><td>socks.png</td><td>socks.bmp</td><td>socks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>font.png</td><td>font.bmp</td><td>256x64 image with font for displaying player names on the back
            of the shirt</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<h4>2.3. config.txt</h4>

<p>
This is the attribute configuration file (in previous Kitservers it was called "attrib.cfg").
As before, it is just a plain text file - you can use Notepad or any other text editor to
view or modify it. For each folder that has shirt or shorts in it (either as part of all-in-one kit,
or as separate image) should have a <b>config.txt</b> file in it. Most of the attributes apply
to the shirt, except for "shorts.number.location", which applies to shorts. That's why you would
still need a config.txt in a folder, which doesn't have a shirt image, but has shorts. Additionally
the attributes "description" and "mask" refer to all parts.</p>

<p>
Here's the summary table of all the supported attributes:
</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Attribute name</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Format</th><th>Example</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>model</b></td>
        <td>identifier for 3D-model of the shirt</td>
        <td>decimal integer</td>
        <td><nobr>model = 37</nobr></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>collar</b></td>
        <td>Presense of collar</td>
        <td>yes/no</td>
        <td><nobr>collar = no</nobr></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>numbers</b></td>
        <td>Filename (with path, relative to kit folder) of the image that contains 
            numbers texture: 256x128 4bit/8bit paletted image</td>

        <td>Filename (with path, relative to kit folder) of the image that contains 
            numbers palette: a 4bit/8bit paletted image. This is the palette that
            will be used for the shorts from kit folder "X", if such shorts are used
        with the current shirt.</td>
        <td>string in double quotes</td>
        <td><nobr>shorts.num-pal.pb = "..\pal-black.png"</nobr></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>shorts.number.location</b></td>
        <td>Where on the shorts the number should be placed. ("off" means the number
will not be displayed at all.)
        </td>
        <td>left|right|both|off</td>
        <td><nobr>shorts.number.location = left</nobr></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>name.location</b></td>
        <td>Where on the shirt the name of the player should be placed. This is useful

        <td><nobr>name.location = top</nobr></td>

    <tr>
        <td><b>logo.location</b></td>
        <td>Where on the shirt the sponsor logo should be placed. (This attribute
is probably not gonna be very useful with kitserver, since if the
team has the logo on the back of the shirt, it will probably be painted
as part of the kit texture itself, by kitmaker)</td>

        <td><nobr>logo.location = off</nobr></td>

        also influences the kit that is selected by default after selecting teams, 
        as PES5 uses it as an indicator whether two kits have similar colors and 
        would be too confusing together. Be careful: This is also the main color 
        of standard mini-kits (not 2.5D)!</td>
        <td>color, written in hexadecimal format RRGGBB (red,green,blue)</td>
        <td><nobr>radar.color = 0A5D88</nobr></td>

        <td><b>description</b></td>
        <td>Here you can specify the name of the kit. This will be used for
        <a href="#kitinfoscreen">kit information</a>, which is explained later.</td>

        <td>This is the mask file that will be applied when splitting the kit for
        mixing parts. You only need this if the splitting rules are non-standard

        information)</td>
        <td>string in double quotes</td>
        <td><nobr>mask = "mask_juve.png"</nobr></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>For examples of <b>shorts.num-pal.<span class="kitid">X</span></b> usage - study the
sample GDB: it contains many different examples. Initially this may look too complicated;
however, after a bit of time, it will become clear why this kind of organization was needed:
In order to be able to freely mix the parts of the kits, you need to be able to specify
what sort of numbers and palettes should be used on shorts in many different situations.

For example, consider the <b>config.txt</b> from Germany "pa" folder:
<pre>
model = 37
collar = no

numbers = "..\..\adidas_black.png"

shorts.number.location = left
shorts.num-pal.pa = "..\..\adidas_white.png"
shorts.num-pal.pb = "..\..\adidas_black.png"
</pre>

<p>
What this means in plain English is the following:<br/>
For the shirt use Adidas numbers (black). When this shirt is used with "pa" shorts, then
apply palette file "adidas_white.png", which effectively renders white numbers on the shorts.
When this shirt is used with "pb" shorts, then apply palette file "adidas_black.png", which
results in black numbers being drawn on the shorts.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Strip Selection and 2.5D kits</h3>

<p>
In order to provide a visual reference for currently selected GDB kits (including extra kits), 
these so-called "2.5D" kits are overlayed on top of the KONAMIs mini-kits. The name originated
from the fact that these are 2Dkits, but they are built with the real textures that are used
in the match. Here's a screenshot:

<img src="stripsel-pl.jpg" />

(When the team doesn't have the kits in GDB, the original KONAMI mini-kits will still be visible.)
</p>

<p>
You can switch between 1st/2nd kits as before - using your keyboard or gamepad - whatever you
have configured. In order to get to the extra kits, press "O" button - to enter "Change Setup"
mode. The little yellow arrows will now move the individual parts of the kit, signalling that
you can start mixing individual parts. This is all standard game functionality - you don't need
to press any special hotkeys to activate that.</p>

<p>
Now comes the Kitserver new feature: by switching to different shirt(shorts,socks) you will 
now be cycling through all available parts, and not just 1st and 2nd choices. In version 5.2.3
you can now cycle in both directions.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to set goalkeepers kits. There are now 2 modes of kit selection: "Player mode" and
"Goalkeepers mode". You can switch between them by pressing <b>[Tab]</b> key. For goalkeeper,
choose the kits the same way as you did for the players. As with player kits, you can mix the
parts, if you go into the "Change Setup" mode.
</p>

<img src="stripsel-gk.jpg" />

<a name="kitinfoscreen">
<p>
Right under the kit preview additional information is displayed. Since there is not enough space,
these are split in some pages between which you can switch withe the <b>[PAGE UP]</b> and
<b>[PAGE DOWN]</b> keys. On the picture you can see the page called "Kit information". It shows the names
of the selected kit parts which can be specified with the "description" attribute. The name is used for
all kit parts in that folder. If nothing is specified the foldername will be used or in case of the
four standard kits (pa, pb, ga and gb) the name "Standard [Home/Away]". As you can see this display
is the second one in standard configuration, so you have to switch to it before.
</p>

<img src="kitinfo.jpg" />

<p>
<div class="note">TROUBLE-SHOOTING tip: people who tried early releases (5.1.0, 5.1.1) have reported some display problems
with 2.5D kits on GeForce FX and GeForce 4 cards: screen flickering, and kits not showing up during
strip selection. Kitserver versions 5.1.2 or newer contain a fix that should eliminate that problem. 
If you still experience this, updating your video card drivers might help.</div>
</p>

<h3 id="kitmakernotes">2.5 Notes for Kitmakers</h3>
<p>One of the most important changes in version 5.2.1 is HDPES. It means that you can use much better
kits now since there is no more restriction of texture size and color depth. For example 1024x512 or
2048x1024 pixels big textures can be used now as long as the aspect ratio is 2 to 1 and the width is
512 multiplied with an integer. All parts are resized in a proportional way, so the texture should look
like before wenn you zoomed in. Furthermore you don't need to care about annoying shared palettes anymore
as the pictures can have more than 256 colors. Accepted are 32 bit images such as a PNG file with alpha
channel and 24 bit images. For the last one Kitserver looks for a 256 color image in the same dimensions
which is called like "all-alpha.png" or "shirt-alpha.bmp". If found, the palette index is taken as alpha
value of the pixel at the same place in the texture. You can find a sample palette named "alpha.pal" in
the kitserver folder. If you use that, black with an index of 0 will stand for full transparency and
white with index 255 for complete opaque. If no alpha file is found, all pixels are taken as opaque.
<div class="note">For now only 256 color images can be used as alpha files, but no real black-white
images. Not the color is important, only the index.</div>
</p>


<img src="mask.png" />
<p>
Something that's also important is the splitting into the individual parts. As before this happens with masks,
but the format has changed. Now all three parts are saved in one file and marked with the colors red (shirt),
blue (shorts) and yellow (socks). By default the "mask.png" in the <b>uni\masks</b> folder ist used. However,
since Juventus has two individual socks you need a changed mask. This can be specified with the "mask" attribute
and is then searched for first relatively to the folder holding the config.txt and then in the "masks" folder.
The mask of the shirt is always used for all parts.<br />
Nevertheless, in spite of all these changes you can still use your existing GDB since all textures are resampled
internally to 32 bit so that you can even mix <b>all</b> kit parts, independant from palette and color depth.
Also combinations of different texture sizes are allowed. It is only important that you copy the "masks" folder,
otherwise splitting will not work.
</p>



<!-- ### BALLSERVER ### -->

<h2 id="ballserver">Ballserver Module 5.2.3 (bserv.dll)</h2>

<h3>3.1 Quick summary of the features</h3>

<p>
<li><b>Ball selection on "Strip Selection" screen.</b><br />
With version 5.2.3 you have now a real 3D preview how the ball will looks ingame.</li>
<li><b>Support for different texture sizes.</b><br />
You can use 256x256, 512x512 and even 1024x1024 pixel textures, saved in either 
BMP or PNG format. The size is auto-detected, so there's no need  to configure it.</li>
</p>

<h3>3.2 GDB configuration</h3>

<p>
Ballserver uses the same GDB folder as the other modules like Kitserver. The subfolder is named 
<b>balls</b>. You'll notice that there is a file inside called <b>map.txt</b> (like in Kitserver) 
to configure the balls. The format is quite simple: one line is one ball, and there are three 
attributes. The first one is the name displayed in the ingame selection, followed by the name of 
the 3D model file and the texture file. Look at the example:
<pre>
# This is the configuration file for Ballserver
# Format: "&lt;name displayed in game&gt;","&lt;model file&gt;","&lt;texture file&gt;"
# Example: "adidas Finale Capitano Grey","ariel_mdl.bin","adidas_finale_capitano_grey.bmp"
# Texture paths are relative to GDB\balls\, model paths to GDB\balls\mdl\

# adidas
"adidas Finale Capitano Grey","ariel_mdl.bin","adidas_finale_capitano_grey.bmp"
"adidas Teamgeist Blue","gwidon_mdl.bin","adidas_teamgeist_blue.png"

# Nike

# Puma

# This comment makes sure you have pressed the enter key after the last ball
</pre>

Please don't forget the quotes, they are important! If your map.txt looks like this (and you have those 
files, of course), you can choose between <i>adidas Finale Capitano Grey</i> and <i>adidas Teamgeist Blue</i> 
in game later. The texture files have to be stored inside the "GDB\balls" folder and the models in "GDB\balls\mdl".</p>

<a name="relfolderexample">
<div class="note">If you want to use other folders, you have to use relative paths like <b>mysubfolder\tex.png</b>
for a file "tex.png" inside "GDB\balls\mysubfolder".</div>
<p>
When downloading balls, you will recognize that quite a lot of balls share one 3D model. In this case, you need 
each model file only once. In general, models are independent from the texture size, so a model delivered with a 256x256 
texture should work with a 512x512 texture as well. If you're unsure, just try it with different models.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Ball selection</h3>
<p>
Start the game just as usual. When you come to Strip Selection, you will see a new text under the mini-kits saying 
<b>"Ball: game choice"</b> by default. In this case, you will recognize no change when playing as the ball you selected in 
the options will be used. Now comes the new feature: press <b>B</b> on your keyboard to select the next ball (or <b>V</b> 
to cycle back). The text will change into <b>"Ball: <i>&lt;name configured in map.txt&gt;</i>"</b> and if everything is
well-configured, you will play with that ball. To choose a random ball, press <b>R</b> and to reset the ball to game choice 
press <b>C</b>. Under the text you can see a 3D preview. It doesn't need any configuration or additional files in the GDB
as it is created from the texture and the model file defined in your map.txt.

<img src="ballsel.jpg" />

If you don't see the text, you have to <a href="#kitinfoscreen">navigate</a> to it. The text at the bottom should
say "Ball selection" then.

<!-- ### FACESERVER ### -->

<h2 id="faceserver">FaceServer Module 5.2.3 (fserv.dll)</h2>

<h3>4.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>
Faceserver is similar to Kitserver and Ballserver, making it possible to load as
much extra faces and extra hair from the GDB as you want. Thanks to some changes
to the internal logic (again), faceserver doesn't have any more problems with
cut-scenes (such as substitutions) and edit mode. Please notice that faceserver
depends on the player ids. As these aren't saved with replays and a team you can
export from the master league, it can't work in these situations. A new module
to fix this is already under development, but not finished yet.</p>

<h3>4.2 How to use</h3>
<p>As a result of the changes you can go to edit mode now to see how the faces look.
In fact you should do this before and after inserting a new face as there are three new
displays at the upper right.</p>

<img src="faceseditmode.jpg" />

<p>The sample face of David Villa was made by Chris79. The player's id is the one that you can
also find in PlayerList.txt and that is needed to configure in map.txt. To add a face to this
player, remember the id and go to your <b>GDB\faces</b> folder. Copy the face there (extract
it before to a bin file if you downloaded a zip file!) and open the <b>map.txt</b> with
notepad. Add a new line after the sample, using the format given in the comment in the upper
part (the player's id followed by the filename in double quotes). The filename is relative to
"GDB\faces", so you can use subfolders (for facepacks or the different teams, or what you like).
In the Ballserver manual you find an <a href="#relfolderexample"> example</a> for that.
That's it. When play the game now, the player will have the face you assigned. To check this,
go back to edit mode and look at the top. When you select a player with a new face, the filename
is displayed. Don't worry about the fact that the face is not shown when you edit a player.
This just shows that it is not saved in your optionfile. In the game you will see it properly.<br /></p>
<p>
Some people seem to have problems finding PlayerList.txt. Although not really needed
anymore, it is still a good overview about the players. You find it in you kitserver folder after
the first time you played the game with Faceserver enabled and closed it. In the new version I added
some more information so <b>you should delete the old file, otherwise it will not be overwritten.</b><br />
You will probably recognize that the new faces are selectable now in edit mode. They are added after
the standard ones. However you shouldn't assign them here for two reasons. First this would be saved
into your optionfile and might cause problems if you disable Faceserver or if you insert new faces.
Second the saved face number is limited to 512. If you configure the new faces using map.txt, you won't
have these problems. Maybe I will build a feature in future versions that adds the player to map.txt when
you select a new face for him, but I wonder if this would be more comfortable as you would still need to
copy the file to your GDB and tell Faceserver to load it. So at the moment you can use it to check the
inserted faces only.<br /></p>
<p>
The way to assign new hair to a player is very similar: Find out the player's id, copy the hair
file to <b>GDB\hair</b> and open <b>GDB\hair\map.txt</b>. The format is exactly the same as for faces,
so look above how to insert a line for the player. Save the file and start the game. If you did
everything right, you will see it in edit mode at the same place as the face filename.
</p>
<div class="note">Most crashes are caused by corrupted files or wrong map files. In case of a crash
please check first if this is the reason before posting in the forums.

<!-- ### STADIUM SERVER ### -->
<h2 id="stadiumserver">Stadium Server Module 5.2.3 (stadium.dll)</h2>
<h3>5.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>
Stadium Server is a plug-in module for Kitserver. It allows to use additional stadiums, which
are organized inside GDB - similar to how kits, balls, and faces are organized.
</p>

<h3>5.2 GDB organization</h3>

<div class="note">This section is mainly for the stadium creators, so that they can organize their stadiums
in the way that stadium server requires. For the user, installing a new stadium would then be
very easy: it would just mean a simple folder copy.</div>

<p>
To add new stadiums to the game, you need to organize them in the GDB in specific way.
The <a href="#stadiumimporter">"Stadium Importer"</a> helps you with that. 
The GDB now has a new folder called <b>stadiums</b>, which holds all the extra stadiums:</p>

<img src="gdb.gif" />

<p>Inside the <b>stadiums</b> folder, each stadium has its own folder. 
For example, you can see 4 stadiums here (the map.txt file will be discussed later):</p>

<img src="stadiums.gif" />

<p>
<div class="note">
    IMPORTANT: The name of the folder will be used by Stadium Server as the name of the stadium, during
    both the matches and in "View Stadiums" mode. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Inside each stadium folder the directory structure is always the same. Each stadium consists of 68 
files: 66 files for the stadium itself + 1 adbords textures BIN + 1 information file 
(info.txt - the year the stadium was built, its capacity and the city are stored in it). The 66 stadium files
are split into 6 folders - one each for the following scenarios of stadium usage: fine day, rainy day,
snowy day, fine night, rainy night, snowy night. The folders are called: 
<b>1_day_fine</b>, <b>2_day_rain</b>, <b>3_day_snow</b>, <b>4_night_fine</b>, <b>5_night_rain</b>,
and <b>6_night_snow</b>. The adboards textures BIN is stored in a folder called <b>adboards_tex</b>.
</p>

<img src="bernabeu.gif" />

<p>The <b>info.txt</b> has a very simple structure. You specify the year the stadium was built,
its capacity and the city were it is like in the example below:</p>

<pre>
# Stadium info file

built = 1999
capacity = 16500
city = London

</pre>

<p>Inside each of the 6 stadium folders, the files have the same fixed names indicating what part
of the stadium they contain. (It's important that you name the files in each of the 6 folders, EXACTLY as shown the picture,
because otherwise stadium server won't be able to load the stadium correctly).
For example, here's the contents of <b>1_day_fine</b> folder:</p>

<img src="dayfine.gif" />

<p>
Some notes by Gwidon about what each file contains:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>File</th><th>Comments</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_a0.str</td>
        <td>away crowd and flags, when there are no away supporters (0-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_a1.str</td>
        <td>away crowd and flags, when stadium has some small number of away supporters (1-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_a2.str</td>
        <td>away crowd and flags for good amount of away supporters (2-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_a3.str</td>
        <td>away crowd and flags for maximum number of away supporters (3-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_h0.str</td>
        <td>home crowd and flags, when there are no home supporters (0-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_h1.str</td>
        <td>home crowd and flags, when stadium has some small number of home supporters (1-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_h2.str</td>
        <td>home crowd and flags for good amount of home supporters (2-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>crowd_h3.str</td>
        <td>home crowd and flags for maximum number of home supporters (3-star)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>stad1_main.bin</td>
        <td>Main stadium file, with textures and models</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>stad2_entrance.bin</td>
        <td>Entrance scene</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>stad3_adboards.bin</td>
        <td>Adboards structure</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>The <b>adboards_tex</b> folder for now contains a single file - <b>default.bin</b>, which 
holds adboards textures to be applied to stadium adboards during the game. (In the future, this
folder might contain other texture BINs, so that we can use different adboards during different
types of matches... But that's a feature that is not here yet.)</p>

<img src="adbtex.gif" />

<h3 id="stadiumimporter">5.3 Stadium Importer</h3>
<p>
A new tool call which you find in your kitserver folder helps you to import new
stadiums into your GDB. It is much more simple than renaming all files manually. Just
extract all 66 files into a folder named <b>kitserver\stadimp\stadium</b> and copy the adboard
file to <b>kitserver\stadimp\adboards.bin</b>. Then start <b>stadimp.exe</b>. Enter the name of the
stadium and check if the right files are copied. Only the first 66 files are copied, sorted
by their names. For this reason you don't need to care about their extension.<br />
After copying, the program ask you to enter some facts about the stadium which will be saved
to the info.txt. At last you can choose to delete the files inside <b>kitserver\stadimp</b>.
</p>

<h3>5.4 map.txt</h3>

<p>
The <b>map.txt</b> in Stadium Server is used slightly differently compared to other modules
(such as Kitserver or Ballserver, etc.). To use a GDB stadium in the game, you don't necessarily
need the map.txt file. However, what it allows to do, is to define a "home stadium" for a team.
Then, whenever the Stadium Server is in the "home team" mode (you can turn it on/off by pressing 
<b>[7]</b> key), it will determine which team is the home team, and try to load the corresponding
stadium from GDB. Here's a simple map.txt, with 2 teams having home stadiums associated with 
them:</p>

<pre>
# Stadium Server map file
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# This config maps team number into its home stadium folder name
# Format: <team-num>,"<folder name>"
# Example: 170,"Santiago Bernabeu"

170,"Santiago Bernabeu"
184,"Saturn Ramenskoye"
</pre>

<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Double quotes are required - just so that there is no ambiguity about 
folder name. For IDs for all the teams - see <a href="uni.txt">uni.txt</a> file</div>

<h3>5.5. Modes of operation</h3>

<p>During the Strip Selection screen, you will see a text showing the currently selected 
stadium (or stadium mode), and 4 new hotkeys will be activated: <b>[7],[8],[9],[0]</b>:
<p>

<img src="selected.jpg" />

<p>Stadium Server basically has 2 modes of operation, where it will load the stadiums from the
GDB: "selected stadium" mode and "home team stadium" mode. Using <b>[9]</b> and <b>[0]</b> keys
you can move back and forth among available GDB stadiums. The <b>[8]</b> randomly picks a 
stadium from the GDB. Pressing <b>[7]</b> key, you alternate between "game choice" and "home
team stadium" mode. If "game choice" is selected - the stadium from the AFS is used.</p>

<img src="hometeam.jpg" />

<h3>5.6. "View Stadiums"</h3>

<p>You can view all of your GDB stadiums in the "View Stadiums" mode of the game. To do that, 
simply press the <b>[1]</b> key. To choose the weather, use the <b>[2]</b> key.
</p>

<img src="viewstadiums.gif" />



<!-- ### LODMIXER ### -->

<h2 id="lodmixer">LOD Mixer Module 5.2.3 (lodmixer.dll)</h2>

<h3>6.1 How to use</h3>

<p>
KitServer now includes another tool - LOD Mixer - as an integrated module. It allows to do
some tweaks to the graphical engine of the game, such as Level-Of-Detail table adjustment, 
enable the crowd on all cameras, choose weather/stadium/etc. for League/Cup/ML games.
</p>
<p>Run <b>lodcfg.exe</b> to configure the LOD Mixer settings. Here's the screenshot of how that
looks (very similar to older standalone version of LOD Mixer 1.6):
</p> 

<img src="lodmixer.gif"/>

<div class="NOTE">
    For complete documentation see this file: <b><a href="lodmixer.txt">lodmixer.txt</a></b>
</div>
<p>
From version 5.2.3 you can change some of the lodmixer settings also ingame if you choose
the corresponding page in Strip Selection (<a href="#kitinfoscreen">see instructions here</a>):
</p>

<img src="lodingame.jpg"/>

<p>
The controls are quite simple: With the keys <b>[1]</b> and <b>[2]</b> you choose the setting
you want to change. With <b>[+]</b> and <b>[-]</b> you can change the value now.
The configuration is saved automatically and also works for friendly matches now.
</p>

<!-- ### Bootserver ### -->

<h2 id="bootserver">Bootserver module 5.5.5 (bootserv.dll)</h2>

<h3>7.1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The idea of Bootserver is similar to Faceserver: you use a map where you assign 
boot images to playes, using player IDs. This allows to overcome the limitation of 9 slots that
the game has for boots - with bootserver, each player can have his own boots. As with faceserver, the bootserver currently doesn't work in Museum Replays,
although ingame instant replays, highlights, and other cut-scenes are fully supported.
</p>

<p>Similar to other modules that use <b>map.txt</b>, you put a player ID and the filename
for the boot texture on one line, separating them by a comma. You can find out the ID for
each player in the Edit Mode: the <b>Player ID:</b> text will be displayed at the top of
the screen. Texture filename needs to be a pathname relative to <b>GDB\boots</b>, so you can 
organize your boots into subfolders if you want, or just have a flat structure with all boots
placed in the "boots" folder itself. It's up to you.<br />
Here is an example of simple map:
</p>

<pre>
# Bootserver map
################

185,"adidas_00.png"  # Barthez
186,"adidas_01.png"  # Thuram
194,"puma.png"       # Zidane
195,"adidas_02.png"  # Henry
217,"Germany\adidas_yellow.png"  # Klose
1791,"adidas_00.png" # Davids
</pre>

<p>
<div class="note">IMPORTANT: In order for bootserver to function 
properly, you need to go to "Edit Boots" menu in Edit mode, and set the <b>Type 1</b> to 
"Editable" boots. (One easy way to accomplish this is to reset all boot types to Default).</div>
</p>


<h3>7.2. "Random boots" setting</h3>

<p>
Bootserver configuration file (bootserv.cfg) contains a setting called <b>random-boots.enabled</b>, which
allows to activate random selection of boots for those players, who don't have a GDB boot assigned
in map.txt. So say, for example, you have a large collection of boot textures, but you don't
fancy writing a long map.txt, specifying boots for hundreds if not thousands of players. Instead
you can just assign boots to a limited number of players that you really care about (players of your Master League team, for example) and let bootserver choose the boots randomly 
for all others. This random choice will occur every match, so it's likely that a player without
specific boots assigned in map.txt, will wear very something new every time.
</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled (set to <b>0</b>). To enable it, just change its value 
to <b>1</b> in bootserv.cfg:

<pre>
random-boots.enabled = 1
</pre>
</p>


<!-- ### ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ### -->

<h2 id="advconfig">Advanced configuration</h2>

<h3>8.1. Master configuration file: kload.cfg</h3>

<p>
Typically, you wouldn't need to modify that, unless you're running into problems, or
want to manually enable/disable individual modules. For example, if you wish
to use ballserver and lodmixer, but don't really want the kitserver module, you can 
do that by modifying the <b>kload.cfg</b> file. Here's how the default config looks:
</p>

<pre>
# Loader configuration file

gdb.dir = ".\"
DLL.num = 9
DLL.0 = "kitserver\zlib1.dll"
DLL.1 = "kitserver\libpng13.dll"
DLL.2 = "kitserver\kserv.dll"
DLL.3 = "kitserver\bserv.dll"
DLL.4 = "kitserver\fserv.dll"
DLL.5 = "kitserver\lodmixer.dll"
DLL.6 = "kitserver\stadium.dll"
DLL.7 = "kitserver\dxtools.dll"
DLL.8 = "kitserver\bootserv.dll"

# DirectX options
dx.force-SW-TnL = 0
dx.emulate-HW-TnL = 0
#dx.fullscreen.width = 1920
#dx.fullscreen.height = 1200
</pre>

<p>The top two DLLs - <b>zlib1.dll</b> and <b>libpng13.dll</b> are needed for PNG
image support. Do not remove those. The bottom 4 are independent modules, which you
can enable or disable at will. For example, to disable kitserver module (<b>kserv.dll</b>),
just comment it out with a "#" symbol at the beginning of the line:
</p>

<pre>
DLL.num = 9
DLL.0 = "kitserver\zlib1.dll"
DLL.1 = "kitserver\libpng13.dll"
#DLL.2 = "kitserver\kserv.dll"
DLL.3 = "kitserver\bserv.dll"
DLL.4 = "kitserver\fserv.dll"
DLL.5 = "kitserver\lodmixer.dll"
DLL.6 = "kitserver\stadium.dll"
DLL.7 = "kitserver\dxtools.dll"
DLL.8 = "kitserver\bootserv.dll"
</pre>

<p>
The <b>dx.force-SW-TnL</b> and <b>dx.emulate-HW-TnL</b> options provide functionality similar to
what 3DAnalyzer does with its "Force SW TnL" and "Emulate HW TnL Caps" settings. If your game
crashes (because of an old graphics card, or some other compatibility issue), and you cannot run
the game with 3DAnalyzer, try these two options - they might be all you need to get the game
working again.<br />
To enable, just change the values from 0 to 1.
</p>

<p>
The last two options - <b>dx.fullscreen.width</b> and <b>dx.fullscreen.height</b> - can be used
to enforce custom resolution in fullscreen mode. <i>Note that those two options are disabled by
default; to enable, remove the comment sign ('#') at the begining of those two lines, and make 
sure you specify resolution that your monitor supports.</i>
</p>
